        This web map is designed to support tourism planning and visitor experience enhancement 
        within the Arugam Bay Tourism Zone by analyzing accessibility to key attractions.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>To identify tourism attractions that are easily accessible from main roads,

            essential facilities such as hotels, transport points, Banks, Supermarkets and major road networks.</li>

        <li>To categorize attractions into <b>Highly Accessible</b>, <b>Moderately Accessible</b>, 
            and <b>Poorly Accessible</b> using buffer distances:
            <ul>
                <li>500 m from main roads</li>

 <p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); max-width:800px; margin:20px auto; 
line-height:1; font-size:12px; text-align:center;">A lush green mangrove forest surrounds Pottuvil lagoon,
 and it is a common sight to see mischievous Sri Lanka Macaque Monkeys jumping from tree to tree. Another 
 relatively common sight is seeing large crocodiles basking in the sun on the banks of the lagoon or on 
 nearby rocks, looking deceivingly calm, and to see one of these animals is exhilarating, to say the
  least. But the best-kept secret about the lagoon is that it is a fantastic place to spot elephants;
   many elephants come here in the evening as a way to cool off and you can watch them frolic in the
    water from a safe distance.

wildlife. Leopards are often spotted on 
early morning or late afternoon safaris. Witness majestic elephants roaming the park’s grasslands and 
drinking from the lagoons. Keep an eye out for crocodiles basking on the banks of the Kumana Lagoon
 or look out for various species of deer, such as sambars and axis deer, roaming the park’s forests.
Kumana is a birder’s paradise, 
so keep your binoculars handy to spot a variety of colourful and fascinating bird species.

line-height:1; font-size:12px; text-align:center;">The Muhudu Maha Vihara is a Buddhist temple with 
over 2000 years of history. The temple is found on the sand dunes of Pottuvil and the 
beautiful white stupa can be seen all the way from Arugam Bay beach. It is believed that the
 location of the temple is where Princess Devi, from the Kelaniya kingdom, landed after her father
  was forced to sacrifice her to appease the gods after a tsunami. Princess Devi arrived in
   the Ruhuna kingdom and married its king, King Kavan Tissa; the princess is better known as 
   Viharamahadevi, mother of the fabled King Dutugamunu. 
The temple is definitely an interesting place to visit, especially if you’re a history buff.

 to forget, even if the surroundings aren't pristine. While the area may lack organized seating and 
 cleanliness, the magic of watching the sun dip below the horizon from a boat ride is truly captivating.

 temple that serves the surrounding community by providing a peaceful space for worship, meditation,

   nearby residents, 
supporting regular rituals, Dhamma teachings, and cultural events.

Buddhist practice in Ampara, offering spiritual services to local Buddhists and contributing to the

        The name crocodile rock is quite misleading as crocodiles are

<br>This accessibility analysis of Twenty five attractions and facilities in the Arugam Bay area demonstrated clear spatial patterns of how well different locations are supported by surrounding infrastructure.</br>
<br>Most of the attractions located along the main coastal road and near the central tourism zone were moderately or highly accessible because they are very close to both major roads and clusters of hotels.</br>
<br>Arugam Bay Surf Point and nearby beach areas have a strong connectedness, which essentially means that tourists can easily access these areas.</br>
<br><b>5 tourist attraction in Highly accessibility zone </br><br>2 tourist attraction in Moderately accessibility zone </br><br>4 tourist attraction in poorly accessibility zone </b></br>
<br>In contrast, those attractions that are far from the main road network, such as those in the south and north of the bay, tended to rank as moderately or poorly accessible due to their lack of nearby accommodation and greater travel distance.</br>
<br>Arugam Bay is a highly tourist-friendly destination, known for its stunning beaches,
 cultural attractions, and vibrant local experiences. The area is well-connected through 
 main roads and public transport, making key tourist sites easily accessible for visitors.
  While some remote spots may require improved access, overall the existing infrastructure
   supports smooth travel and exploration. With its combination of natural beauty, recreational
    opportunities, and accessibility, Arugam Bay offers a welcoming and convenient experience for 
    tourists of all kinds.
